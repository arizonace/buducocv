As of 20256-07-10, The files ArizonaEdwards-resume.pdf and acedwards.pdf are the same file.
When the AI version _ArizonaEdwards-resume.pdf_ was first created in April of 2025, 
it replaced acedwards.pdf as the standard resume.
The previous standard, which was a print of the concise view, was renamed to acedwards-compact.pdf.

_In retrospect, it would have been better to rename acedwards.pdf to acedwards-concise.pdf 
as now there has to be a copy of the file with that name._

The AI version has since been updated and is now distributed as ArizonaEdwards-resume.pdf.
At this time, the content of acedwards.pdf was also updated to match the updated ArizonaEdwards-resume.pdf.
There is another copy of ArizonaEdwards-resume.pdf in tub/CraftedCV/ where it was initially placed.
