        <ul>
          <li>The data gathering and delivery systems on which I worked, consisted of many instances of many interoperating bits of software across distributed systems. Market driven changes in our product constantly required new applications as well as enhancements to existing ones.</li>

          <li>The infrastructure maintains a pipeline of customer requests respecting enforced delays, time embargoes, customer entitlements, customer portfolios, and customer preferences.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Quality control for this project included format and value comparison of a wide spectra of fields for millions of securities without any metadata. I was able to validate the contents of each field against information derived from the whole file.</li>

      <li>I developed and enhanced applications to monitor and control communications between devices over a MILSTD1553 serial interface and display real-time visualizations of the traffic.
        <ul>
          <li>My object-oriented data model allowed very flexible design and implementation of multiple views of the protocol analysis of each type of packet, ranging from visual depictions of elements in the aircraft dashboard, down to raw data, all the way down to individual bits.</li>
          <li>I used code structure, self documenting code, and the .Net reflection capabilities of Managed C++ to extract metadata about the meanings of bits and bit sets so that even in hexadecimal and binary raw data views, I show tooltips with interpretive information when the mouse hovers over data.</li>
          <li>When communicating with devices on the serial bus, the program can act as bus master or slave, it can emulate the aircraft control system, it can capture traffic, it can playback one side of a captured conversation and monitor/capture the other, and it can control playback of PIR and RADAR sensor data captured during real events in real aircraft.</li>
          <li>I developed and enhanced software to control a PCI card that can capture multi-channel PIR data from the system's optical sensors and can playback recorded sequences to the central processor during testing. This software communicates with the card using PCI FIFO channels mapped to virtual memory addresses.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I designed and developed an AN/APR-39 (Radar Warning System) simulator that could communicate with a physical AN/AAR-47 (Laser Warning System) and emulate and test the protocols for startup, version detection, and control/display integration for aircraft with both systems.</li>
      <li>I designed, prototyped, and programmed an Arduino based device in a nicely enclosed, externally-powered breadboard package with RS485 over USB connectivity. The device controlled several relays and switches via GPIO including the main power to the test rack. I was assisted in this project by my own interns and an electrical engineering intern. This allowed the test software to control the physical configuration of the test rack, reducing human intervention, improving reliability, and enabling long-running overnight test suites.</li>
      <li>I Developed auxiliary servers and libraries using C++ and C# along with Python interface classes so the binary applications could interoperate with Python in the test framework.</li>

          <p>Greyhound PackageXpress allows retail customers to ship packages via Greyhound bus lines.

The ticket agents used workstations attached to a luggage scale, a receipt printer, a regular printer, and a debit card PIN pad, along with other peripherals. My job was to write an Active-X control to allow the web application to communicate with the luggage scale via the parallel port and the debit PIN pad over the serial port.</p>

    <h3 class="highlights">Challenges overcome for this project include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A retrograde and unsupported hardware environment. Due to external limitations, the platform was restricted to IE6 on Windows 98 on older computers, with older UARTs. Active-X was the only feasible client side technology available.</li>
      <li>A retrograde and unsupported development environment. Due to additional limitations, the control could not be pre-installed and had to be configured to auto-install on demand over-the-web with limited user interaction. I developed the control as a single, signed, self-registering, Active-X DLL. The HTML host wrapper declared it via CLSID/GUID with a codebase URL for auto-installation. A signature from a trusted authority allowed for minimally intrusive self installation.</li>
      <li>The luggage scale's parallel port protocol was asynchronous and extemporaneous. The scale had a non-negligible bounce during which time it continued reporting weight values over the parallel port. I had to make my own determination of the stable weight. The weight displayed on the page was updated but not reported to the backend until it had stabilized. Of course the user could meanwhile be interacting with the page in any way.</li>
      <li>IE6 hosts Active-X controls strictly in a single-threaded-apartment (STA) where the context and lifetime are tied to the webpage. The control needed to create and manage separate multi-threaded-apartments to create the multiple threads needed to maintain semi-persistent asynchronous communications with the parallel port. The control had to manage its own serialization and synchronization with the main STA, which was tricky because Windows/IE6 has its own separate mechanism for serializing the control's STA.</li>
      <li>Communicating with the PIN pad was synchronous and more reliable, but navigating the handshaking and security protocols was more complex and time consuming. Testing was limited to a fixed set of predetermined interactions supported by the pad in test mode.</li>
      <li>I authored the control's documentation in HTML and JavaScript.</li>

Even back in 2002, on computers with a fraction of a gigabyte of memory, the program comfortably sorted, displayed, and operated on folders with over a million files.</li>
      <li>To implement a rich modern FTP client, I had to understand and implement many Internet RFCs, and overcome many challenges endemic to the protocol in a modern environment, such as firewalls, encryption, NAT traversal, non-routable addresses, and Port and Passive callbacks.</li>
      <li>I delved deeply into the Windows SDK; GDI; GUI; shell integration; resource management; internationalization; threading; thunking; algorithms; memory usage; performance; persistence; COM; ATL; SSL; SSH; PKI; digital signatures; key exchange; encryption, and secure sessions.</li>
      <li>I helped to maintain and administer test environments of FTP and SSH servers on Windows and Linux.</li>
      <li>As a principal developer, I travelled to and participated in company design and architecture meetings, as well as product feature and strategy meetings.</li>

      <li>I created pixel-perfect sample quizzes for Microsoft Word and Excel using ToolBook. The tests requested the candidate to accomplish tasks using menus and shortcut keys. The tester wanted the candidate to have access to the full menu and all shortcut keys so they would not be prompted to the correct answers by limited choices. I took screenshots of all the menus and submenus in Word and Excel, and simulated the menu system in ToolBook complete with mouse tracking, highlighting, sub-menu popups and keyboard accelerators. I wrote most of the painting code in a C DLL which I called from ToolBook scripts. I was also able to simulate limited functionality of some other features such as cut and paste (of specific text - not arbitrary text) but including full emulation of modifier keys for copy vs move with caret and cursor indication.</li>

      <li>I designed and implemented an efficient program to solve a challenging accounting problem that equitably allocated funds orthogonally and hierarchically between various departments, accounts, and projects without losing or gaining pennies. I was able to do this rapidly and correctly despite previous failed attempts by others because of my strong understanding of data structures and algorithms.</li>
      <li>I developed a check-printing program that communicated with a secure magnetic ink (MICR) printer via its secure protocol. The program converted and spelled out the dollar amount in words on the check.</li>
      <li>I developed a code strategy for generating dynamic SQL in situations where the equivalent stored procedures contained too many code paths to be maintainable.</li>
      <li>I developed a query technique to load and display large result sets achieving apparent sub-second latency for queries that had often taken more than a minute.</li>
      <li>I developed custom data controls for viewing and quickly scrolling through large result sets. My controls were noticeably much more responsive and efficient than the Windows 3.1 controls available at the time. Using simple animation principles, I based the number of fields in dynamic queries based on how fast the scroll position was changing.</li>
      <li>I created several custom controls and Window classes that emulated the Windows 95 look and feel in the Windows 3.1 environment, including, buttons, checkboxes, property pages, scrollbars and sliders. This required implementing several features at the Windows SDK level in C, including window message loops, tabs, arrow keys, accelerator keys, navigating between sibling, parent and child windows, mouse handling and capture, hit tests, client area and child window management, and of course painting.</li>

          <p>As a solution generalist, I used many platforms, applications and languages, but of note, I started on a Xerox 8010 (the original Xerox Star) forerunner to GUI systems such as Macintosh and Windows. 1989 - 1992 was a dynamic period and the work environment evolved through many changes in computing platforms, languages, and network technologies. In a document production role, I used publishing software to enter and format standardized tests including Teacher Certification Tests (TCT), Curriculum Based Assessment, and other tests for the State of Georgia. </p>
          <p>I was assistant Network Administrator for our Novell Network, and for a time the acting Network Administrator.</p>
          <p>I programmed in Pascal, C, C++, Paradox, batch files and application languages such as WordPerfect to support the test development, statistical, and administrative workflows.</p></td>
